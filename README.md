Designed and developed VAR system  using drones and computer vision, with 5-developer team among 25 teams for 36 hours. 

**VAR** is a application that gives firefighters a birdâ€™s eye view of the terrain and help them determine where the fire
moves next using drones, so they can swiftly make decisions about where crews should go and who should be evacuated.
Which could save the consumption of millions of acres of land and property in billions of dollars that could be caused by a fire.
